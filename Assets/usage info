Changes:
- the font file
- the font file extention
- the main editor script file
- the canvas name


how to use:
- add one canvas only in the scene
- add the font file to  the fonts root and name it font
* defint the font file that should be used
- convert atlases (it will auto make it self anyway)
- convert wedgits one by one, or scene by scene
- make sure the canvas size == the root size
- make sure the canvas is in the UI layer
- make sure to assign the NGUI camer to the canvas even camera
- make sure the camera mask displaying the UI layer stuff


Limitations:
- any custom wedgits will not be used
- it should run with the latest ngui ( or earlier version that have no major API changes)
- BBCode on the Text is not going to work
- the UILabels which set to Automatic, it's result is not expected.
